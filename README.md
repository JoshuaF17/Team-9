# Team-9 - DOG FINDER - PROJECT

In the GitHub repository, you will find all the necessary files and classes needed to run our java program. (also include the jfxrt.jar file if needed).

This is our final version. However, the logic is skewed. We had a running version in which the logic works. When we were parsing out our code into different classes, we ran into a logic issue we could not figure out. We believe it is because Java creates the pages and everything in the beginning and does not actually update our Human object's variables, resulting in only one best match for everything. 

We have included a ZIP file of our logically correct code in our GitHub and will do the same in D2L. Please take a look at this to see what we were trying to achieve.

Our Project description, contract and UML can be found on D2L.

To run our code, if you are running in terminal or a console:
1. Place all files in one folder
2. Compile the necessary files
3. Run DogFinder.java class (java DogFinder)

To run our logically correct code
1. Unzip all the files from zip file
2. Should be all in the same folder, so compile neccessary files
3. Run DropdownMenu1.java class (java DropdownMenu1)

If you have any questions, please feel free to email one of us. 
Thank you for the great semester!
